2. [Query and Time-Series : ](https://gisbymonica.github.io/30DayMapChallenge/Earthquake-Analysis.html) This page queries Earthquake features on the client side and enables users to view time-series data using ArcGIS JS API 4.20.

3. [Spatial Query and Statistics : ](https://gisbymonica.github.io/30DayMapChallenge/Earthquake-Buffer-Analysis.html) This page allows you to draw a buffer and returns the statistics of the earthquakes occurred within the buffer region.


#### Google Earth Engine

1. [Vegetation Moisture Time Series : ](https://monicamons12.users.earthengine.app/view/us-vegetation-dryness) This is a project where I employed GEE JavaScript and derived SAR dataset to plot the time series information of Leaf Moisture percentages.
   
      [Snapshot of Code : ](https://code.earthengine.google.com/bba0f4195da4d0b57c32a8a46051ed07) The codebase of the above project can be found here.



#### Django-Python-OSM

1. [OSM Extraction and Routing : ](https://github.com/gisbymonica/DjangoGIS) This links to a GitHub repo wherein you could find the code for a web-app that I developed to display the streets, buildings and hospitals of Chennai that I extracted from OSM using OSMNX package. The app displays the shortest route between two points calculated using OSMNX and rendered using Folium.
   
      [Jupyter Notebook : ](https://github.com/gisbymonica/30DayMapChallenge/blob/main/OSM_Extraction.ipynb) This is the notebook that contains the initial exploratory code that I wrote before developing the concept as a web app.
