My current work involves big data analysis and large scale data science applications utilizing geospatial technology. I work with different imagery types and I am currently involved with looking at time series data & analysis of natural systems coupled with system modeling and periodicity. Most of my work includes but is not limited to remote sensing applications, large scale data processing and management, API support along with network analysis and geostatistical methods. I like solving puzzles and problems, building tools and plugins and working from the perspective of the end user with limited access.
