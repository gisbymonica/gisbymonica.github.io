The Earth and the variety of species it holds always gives me an unquantifiable level of happiness. But our Earth faces more challenges now, more than ever. Luckily, I can contribute my part in the run to preserve the Earth as we find it amusing. As a geospatial enthusiast, I hope to use my abilities to work with GIS technologies for the better. Fundamentally I am a GIS Developer who graduated in Geoinformatics. I am highly skilled in Javascript, Python, ReactJS and C#. My work predominantly revolves around developing web-based GIS applications. Because of the power of Geospatial and it's ability to address a lot of problems in various different sectors apart from Earth Observation, my professional experience also is varied, ranging from developing GIS based applications for managing national security to aid in large-scale construction to helping the urban planners and so on. I, personally, am interested in using GIS for Earth Observation and am equipping myself on an every-day basis to solve various problems using geostatistical analysis and machine learning.

Query and Time-Series : This page queries Earthquake features on the client side and enables users to view time-series data using ArcGIS JS API 4.20. Spatial Query and Statistics : This page allows you to draw a buffer and returns the statistics of the earthquakes occurred within the buffer region. Google Earth Engine \u00b6 Vegetation Moisture Time Series : This is a project where I employed GEE JavaScript and derived SAR dataset to plot the time series information of Leaf Moisture percentages. Snapshot of Code : The codebase of the above project can be found here. Django-Python-OSM \u00b6 OSM Extraction and Routing : This links to a GitHub repo wherein you could find the code for a web-app that I developed to display the streets, buildings and hospitals of Chennai that I extracted from OSM using OSMNX package. The app displays the shortest route between two points calculated using OSMNX and rendered using Folium. Jupyter Notebook : This is the notebook that contains the initial exploratory code that I wrote before developing the concept as a web app. ArcGIS Online Apps \u00b6 Houston Evacuation Map : This app shows the evacuation routes in Houston, TX, USA and the at-risk population who reside in the region but without a vehicle who in case of a hurricane would be requiring assistance. ArcGIS Story Maps \u00b6 Story Map on Beirut Explosion : I authored this report on Beirut Explosion using ArcGIS Story Maps.
